      <h2>Tech for Good: Advancing Math Education with AI and UX</h2>
      <p>A collaborative initiative with SAGE AI, this project aimed to harness artificial intelligence and user-centered design to improve mathematics education in underserved communities. The project focused on designing accessible, adaptive learning tools powered by AI to identify student difficulties and offer targeted support.</p>
      <p>My contribution involved developing intelligent feedback systems that analyze student behavior and learning patterns. We also implemented UX enhancements to make the platform more inclusive, intuitive, and engaging for both students and educators.</p>
      <p>This work demonstrates how AI and thoughtful design can promote equity and innovation in education.</p>

      <h2>Educational Feedback Analysis Assistant</h2>
      <p>An AI-powered chatbot application built with Streamlit, designed to support educators in diagnosing student learning challenges. Unlike previous versions, this tool does not use a Neo4j knowledge graph but provides an intuitive interface for uploading datasets and receiving targeted feedback on student errors.</p>
      <p>The interface includes interactive buttons that allow educators to explore grade distributions, item difficulty and discrimination indices, and the different stages of student errors based on educational theory. This assistant helps visualize key learning patterns and supports data-driven decision-making in the classroom.</p>
