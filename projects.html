      <h2>LLM-Powered Student Error Analyzer in Math</h2>
      <p>Designed and developed an interactive web application to analyze student math responses using large language models (LLMs).</p>
      <p>The tool compares student answers with correct solutions and automatically explains their mistakes while categorizing them using general error types and <strong>Newman’s Error Analysis</strong> (NEA).</p>
      <p>Supports both <strong>OpenAI GPT-4o</strong> and <strong>Gemini 2.0 Flash</strong>, with an instruction inbox to guide LLM responses based on custom mathematical concepts.</p>
      <p>Users upload CSV datasets and receive annotated feedback with explanations, summaries, and NEA labels. Results are downloadable as CSV.</p>
      <p>Technologies: Python, Streamlit, OpenAI API, Google Gemini API, pandas</p>

        <h2>Tailwind CSS Mini Projects</h2>
        <p>Built a collection of responsive UI components using Tailwind CSS, including a pricing table, Pomodoro timer, and testimonial section.</p>
        <p>Each mini project is structured with its own <code>index.html</code> and styled entirely with utility-first Tailwind CSS classes.</p>
        <p>The repository is organized for modular development and browser-based preview of individual components.</p>
        <p>Technologies: HTML, Tailwind CSS, GitHub</p>

      <h2>AI-Powered Educational Feedback Assistant</h2>
      <p>Developed a math education assistant for analyzing student performance using STACK datasets.</p>
      <p>Integrated GPT-4o chatbot and Streamlit dashboards for insights on grades, error types, and NEA error categories.</p>
      <p>Users can upload datasets or explore a default one; chatbot runs with user-provided OpenAI API keys.</p>
      <p>Technologies: Python, Streamlit, LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4o, MongoDB, ChromaDB</p>

      <h2>EduStackBot – Intelligent Student Error Analysis</h2>
      <p>Designed and implemented an interactive RAG-powered web app that diagnoses student misconceptions directly from free-form math responses.</p>
      <p>Combines vector similarity search over a <strong>Neo4j</strong> knowledge graph with dynamic <strong>Cypher-generated</strong> queries to ground answers in prior student data and curriculum content.</p>
      <p>A ReAct agent orchestrates two tools—graph Q&amp;A and similarity retriever—to craft feedback that labels each mistake with both general categories and <strong>Newman’s Error Analysis</strong> (NEA) levels.</p>
      <p>Supports both <strong>OpenAI GPT-4o</strong> and <strong>Gemini 2.0 Flash</strong>; an instruction inbox lets educators steer the LLM toward custom mathematical concepts.</p>
      <p>Streamlit UI offers real-time chat plus CSV batch uploads. Users receive downloadable, NEA-annotated results complete with explanations and remediation tips.</p>
      <p>Technologies: Python, Streamlit, LangChain, Neo4j, OpenAI API, Google Gemini API, pandas</p>

      <h2>Tech for Good: Advancing Math Education with AI and UX</h2>
      <p>A collaborative initiative with SAGE AI, this project aimed to harness artificial intelligence and user-centered design to improve mathematics education in underserved communities. The project focused on designing accessible, adaptive learning tools powered by AI to identify student difficulties and offer targeted support.</p>
      <p>My contribution involved developing intelligent feedback systems that analyze student behavior and learning patterns. We also implemented UX enhancements to make the platform more inclusive, intuitive, and engaging for both students and educators.</p>
      <p>This work demonstrates how AI and thoughtful design can promote equity and innovation in education.</p>
